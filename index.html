			<h1>Interests</h1>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Inhaling front-end development skills:</span> I wake up everyday and look to learn something new. There's so much information that it's difficult, perhaps even impossible to be great at all of it, but that doesn't stop me from trying.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Playing the guitar:</span> Although I haven't had as much time as I used to, playing the guitar and jamming with some bongo drums hanging out with friends is my idea of an perfect afternoon</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Ping-pong addict:</span> Growing up I played tennis and basketball all day. Whenever we'd find a break, my friends and I would play ping-pong for hours, it's quite possibly my favorite game.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Reading:</span> during my downtime I love to just grab a good book and learn something new, I can never get enough of books.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Hanging out with my wife and kids:</span> no activity on Earth quite compares to conversing and interacting with my family.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Loving God:</span> Jesus Christ is my savior and has blessed me with a wonderful life. I'll never be perfect but I maintain my relationship with Him and live by His grace.</li>
